The purpose of this simulation is to examine the performance of charging station recommendation systems 
when using different strategies. By default, all strategies are visible and can be compared.
The results of each run are saved in the results folder. Benchmark results of previous runs with low, medium and high charging
infrastructure are saved in the respectively named folders for reference.
